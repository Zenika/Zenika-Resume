# Zenika Resume

A Markdown resume editor based on Monod (see the original Monod readme below).

## Production environment

The app is hosted on Clever Cloud. The authentication is provided by Auth0.
Contact dreamlab@zenika.com to get access to either of those.

## Development üõ†

> :information_source: Requires the Hasura CLI

- Start attached services with `docker-compose up -d postgres hasura`
- Apply database migrations with `cd .hasura && hasura migrate apply`

### Running locally

> :warning: Requires Node.js 5.7, no more, no less

- Start the back-end server with `HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm start`
  - You may use nodemon to enable live reload using `HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:8080 npx nodemon server/server.js`
- Start the front-end server with `npm run dev`


### Running using Docker Compose üê≥

- `docker-compose up --build -d`

This builds and runs the production version of the app. You'll need to rebuild to see changes.

Monod is a (relatively) secure and offline-first Markdown editor we built at
TailorDev in order to learn [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) (and a
bunch of JavaScript tools/libraries). We mainly dedicated two **Le lab** sessions
to this project:

* [Introducing Le lab with ‚ÄúMonod‚Äù, our Markdown
  Editor](https://tailordev.fr/blog/2016/03/11/introducing-le-lab-with-monod-our-markdown-editor/)
* [Le lab #2 ‚Äî Offline-First, Document Sharing, Templates: Monod is Back (not in
  Black)](https://tailordev.fr/blog/2016/04/15/le-lab-2-offline-first-document-sharing-templates-monod-is-back/)

## Usage

Either you use our public instance at: https://monod.lelab.tailordev.fr/, or you
host Monod at home, on your server, or on Heroku.

[![Deploy to
Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Installation


### Production

    $ git clone https://github.com/TailorDev/monod.git
    $ npm install #¬†will run `npm run build`
    $ npm prune --production

We use this
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/TailorDev/dockerfiles/blob/master/node/Dockerfile)
to run Monod in production (which runs `npm run start` from Monod root
directory).

### Development

    $ git clone https://github.com/TailorDev/monod.git
    $ npm install
    $ npm run dev

The last command runs the development server at
[`http://localhost:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080), and use Hot Module
Replacement. You can override the default host and port through env (`HOST`,
`PORT`).

You should also start the server by running:

    $ MONOD_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data npm run start

`MONOD_DATA_DIR` is an environment variable that configures where the server
is supposed to read/write Monod's data. It defaults to `./data/` (so be sure
to create this directory if you run `npm run start`).

You are all set!

### Other Commands

#### `npm run build`

Builds the client-side application in `build/` (production ready)

#### `npm run stats`

Webpack build + generate a JSON file with metrics. [We blogged on why it can be
useful](https://tailordev.fr/blog/2016/03/17/loading-dependencies-asynchronously-in-react-components/).

#### `npm run lint`

Runs [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).

#### `npm run lint:fix`

Fix all ESLint problems.


## Requirements

We use `node` 5.8+ and `npm` 3.7+.
